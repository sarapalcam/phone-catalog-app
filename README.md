# PhoneApp 
## Phone catalog App developed for Zignaly

### The project

This is a simple product catalog app developed in 48 hours for a technical selection process for the company [Zignaly](https://zignaly.com/). On the landing page, there is an overview of four mobile phones with their respectives images, names and prices. When you click on one of the phones, a few more details about the selected phone are shown.

This project has two git branches: ```main``` and ```redux-state```. In the ```main``` branch the app has been developed with React and Node.js. The ```redux-state``` branch contains the same app developed with React-Redux and Node.js. 

Why thse two branches? You may be wondering. Well, this is my first try with Redux and some details are not quite polished, so I thought that it was better not to merge to main jet.
